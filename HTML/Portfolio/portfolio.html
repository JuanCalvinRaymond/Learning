    <h3>Discord Bot</h3>
      Created a discord bot that will parse user messages and when it find a syntax it will replace the message with a timestamp. This project is inspired because I play games with friend from all around the world and everytime we try to schedule a time we're always asking if it's est or pst or somewhere in EU. instead of going to a website to convert the time into a timestamp, having a bot that will do it for you is much faster and easier.

    <h3>Aerospace Campus Project</h3>
      Help Contruction Research Centre (CRC) to build a virtual tour experience of the Aerospace Campus building.

    <h3>Capstone Project</h3>
      As my final year project, I built a VR game using Unity and C#. The game is a shooting experience where the player shoots targets while riding a roller coaster. Players earn extra points for performing tricks while shooting. I created our own UI interaction system from how to detect which control is being hovered, how to handle click and double click event, as well as all the core gameplay mechanics, including the shooting system, trick detection, and scoring logic.
